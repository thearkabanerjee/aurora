# Aurora.AI — small assignment deliverables


This repository contains a single-section landing page (semantic HTML + external CSS) built to the spec. The headline uses pure CSS animations (keyframes) — a wavy gradient and a subtle float. No JS frameworks, no external CSS libraries.


## Files
- `index.html` — semantic HTML markup
- `style.css` — external stylesheet containing all styles and animations


## Deploy quickly


### Netlify (drag & drop)
- Create a folder, place `index.html` and `style.css` inside.
- Zip the folder or leave it.
- Sign in to Netlify and use the Sites -> Add new site -> "Deploy manually" -> Drag & drop the folder/zip.
- After deployment, Netlify will give you a live link. Submit that link.


### Vercel (CLI or web)
- Option A (web): Create a new project, import from GitHub after pushing the files to a repo.
- Option B (quick): Install Vercel CLI, run `vercel` in the folder and follow prompts. The CLI will return a live URL.


## Evaluation checklist
- Semantic HTML: headings, nav, main, section, footer are used.
- External CSS used: `style.css`.
- Animation: `@keyframes` — waveGradient, floatText, glitch, orbit, shoot.
- No external libraries used.


## Small notes
- To edit copy or colors, open `style.css` and tweak the variables at the top.
- Want me to deploy it for you? I can't access your account but I can give exact commands or a ready-to-upload ZIP if you want.
