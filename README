# Aurora.AI Landing Page

## Concept
Aurora.AI is an imaginative startup that brings the **night sky to your doorstep** with an AI companion that guides you through constellations, cosmic events, and personalized star tours.

## Features

- **CSS Animations**:
  - Wavy gradient and floating effect on the hero headline.
  - Glitch animation on the dot in “Aurora.AI”.
  - Orbiting planets and shooting star in the hero visual.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adjusts for smaller screens with a single-column hero.
